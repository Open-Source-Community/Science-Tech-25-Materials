# üß≠ Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

## üìå What is LCA?

The **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes in a tree is the **lowest (deepest)** node that has both nodes as descendants (a node can be a descendant of itself).

---

## üéØ Why is LCA Important?

LCA is a fundamental concept in computer science, useful in:

- **Computational biology** (e.g., phylogenetic trees)
- **File systems** (e.g., finding common directories)
- **Version control systems** (e.g., finding merge bases)
- **Network routing** (e.g., hierarchical routing trees)
- **Competitive programming and graph theory**

It allows us to efficiently solve problems like:

- Finding the **distance** between two nodes
- Solving **range queries** on trees
- **Optimizing** dynamic programming on trees

## üßÆ Algorithms to Find LCA

### 1. Binary Lifting

- **Preprocessing Time:** O(N log N)
- **Query Time:** O(log N)
- Uses dynamic programming to store 2^i-th ancestors.
- Ideal for multiple online queries.

### 2. Euler Tour + RMQ (Range Minimum Query)

- **Preprocessing Time:** O(N log N)
- **Query Time:** O(1)
- Converts the tree into an array via Euler Tour.
- Uses Segment Tree or Sparse Table for RMQ.
- Very fast for online queries.

### 3. Tarjan‚Äôs Offline Algorithm

- **Total Time (for Q queries):** O(N + Q)
- Uses Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union).
- Works efficiently when all queries are known in advance (offline queries).

### 4. Naive Parent Traversal

- **Query Time:** O(N)
- Traverse parent chains until common ancestor is found.
- Simple but slow ‚Äî not suitable for large trees or many queries.

| Algorithm             | Preprocessing | Query Time | Use Case                  |
|----------------------|---------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Binary Lifting        | O(N log N)    | O(log N)   | Many **online** queries   |
| Euler Tour + RMQ      | O(N log N)    | O(1)       | Many **online** queries   |
| Tarjan‚Äôs Algorithm    | O(N + Q)      | O(1)       | Many **offline** queries  |
| Naive Traversal       | None          | O(N)       | Small trees / few queries |

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- All methods assume the tree is **rooted**.
- For dynamic trees (changing structure), more complex data structures like **Link/Cut Trees** are used.


# üß≠ Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in C++ Using Euler Tour + RMQ (No Classes or Structs)

This guide explains how to compute the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** in a tree using an **Euler Tour** and **Range Minimum Query (RMQ)** with a **Sparse Table**, all in **plain C++ without using classes or structs**. The tree is represented as an adjacency list using `vector<vector<int>>`.

---

## üìå What is the LCA?

The **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes `u` and `v` in a tree is the **deepest node** that is an ancestor of both `u` and `v`. It's a fundamental operation in many tree-based algorithms and is commonly used in competitive programming and computer science research.

---

## üí° Overview of the Approach

We solve the LCA problem using:

1. **Euler Tour**: Traverse the tree and record:
   - Each node visit.
   - Depth of each node when visited.
   - First occurrence of each node in the tour.
2. **Range Minimum Query (RMQ)**: Use a Sparse Table to quickly query the node with minimum depth between any two positions in the Euler tour ‚Äî this corresponds to the LCA.

This approach transforms the LCA problem into an RMQ problem.

---

## üß± Data Structures Used

- `tree`: adjacency list for representing the tree.
- `euler`: stores the order of visited nodes in the Euler tour.
- `depth`: depth of each node at time of visit in the Euler tour.
- `first_occurrence`: index of the first occurrence of each node in `euler`.
- `st[][]`: sparse table to perform range minimum queries on `depth`.
- `log_table[]`: precomputed floor of log base 2 values for fast queries.

## üî£ Full C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100005; // max number of nodes
const int LOG = 20;      // log2(MAXN)

vector<vector<int>> tree;
vector<int> euler, depth, first_occurrence;
int st[2 * MAXN][LOG];
int log_table[2 * MAXN];

// Perform DFS to generate Euler tour
void dfs(int node, int d, int parent) {
    first_occurrence[node] = euler.size();
    euler.push_back(node);
    depth.push_back(d);

    for (int child : tree[node]) {
        if (child != parent) {
            dfs(child, d + 1, node);
            euler.push_back(node);
            depth.push_back(d);
        }
    }
}

// Build sparse table over the depth array
void buildSparseTable() {
    int n = depth.size();

    log_table[1] = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        log_table[i] = log_table[i / 2] + 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        st[i][0] = i;

    for (int j = 1; (1 << j) <= n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i + (1 << j) <= n; i++) {
            int l = st[i][j - 1];
            int r = st[i + (1 << (j - 1))][j - 1];
            st[i][j] = (depth[l] < depth[r]) ? l : r;
        }
    }
}

// Query LCA of u and v
int lca(int u, int v) {
    int left = first_occurrence[u];
    int right = first_occurrence[v];
    if (left > right) swap(left, right);
    int j = log_table[right - left + 1];
    int l = st[left][j];
    int r = st[right - (1 << j) + 1][j];
    return (depth[l] < depth[r]) ? euler[l] : euler[r];
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    int n = 9; // number of nodes
    tree.resize(n);
    first_occurrence.resize(n);

    // Build tree
    tree[0] = {1, 2};
    tree[1] = {3, 4};
    tree[2] = {5, 6};
    tree[5] = {7, 8};

    // Step 1: Perform Euler tour starting from root
    dfs(0, 0, -1);

    // Step 2: Build RMQ over depth array
    buildSparseTable();

    // Step 3: Answer LCA queries
    int u = 4, v = 8;
    cout << "LCA of " << u << " and " << v << " is: " << lca(u, v) << endl;

    return 0;

- Node `0` is the root.
- Edges:  
  - `0 ‚Üí 1, 2`  
  - `1 ‚Üí 3, 4`  
  - `2 ‚Üí 5`  
  - `5 ‚Üí 7, 8`

## üìà Euler Tour and Depth

The **Euler Tour** is the sequence of nodes visited during a depth-first traversal where we record a node both when we enter and after finishing each child.

- **Euler Tour (Nodes):**  
  `[0, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 0, 2, 5, 7, 5, 8, 5, 2, 0]`

- **Depth at Each Step:**  
  `[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0]`

- **First Occurrence in Euler Tour:**  
  - `first_occurrence[3] = 2`  
  - `first_occurrence[4] = 4`  
  - `first_occurrence[5] = 8`  
  - `first_occurrence[7] = 9`  
  - `first_occurrence[8] = 11`  

---

## ‚ùì Sample Query: `LCA(4, 8)`

### Step 1: Find First Occurrences
- `first_occurrence[4] = 4`
- `first_occurrence[8] = 11`

### Step 2: Query RMQ on `depth[4..11]`
We extract the depths from index 4 to 11:

- Subarray of depths: `[2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3]`

Minimum value = `0`  
‚Üí This occurs at index `6` in the full Euler tour  
‚Üí `euler[6] = 0`

### ‚úÖ Result:
`LCA(4, 8) = 0`

---

## üß† Intuition

- The LCA of two nodes is the **lowest (deepest) node** that is an ancestor of both.
- By using the **Euler tour**, we flatten the tree into an array where LCA queries become RMQ problems on the **depth** array.
- The node with the **minimum depth** between the **first appearances** of the two nodes in the Euler tour is their LCA.

---

## üèÅ Conclusion

- **LCA(4, 8) = 0**
- Works in **O(1)** query time after **O(N log N)** preprocessing.
- Scales well to large trees and multiple queries.
